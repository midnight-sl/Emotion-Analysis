I will wait for you till the day I can forget you or till the day you realize you cannot forget me.
It hurts to breathe because every breath I take proves I can’t live without you.
The saddest thing in the world, is loving someone who used to love you.
There is no disguise which can hide love for long where it exists, or simulate it where it does not.
Sometimes I just want to give up, go crawl under my covers and cry myself to sleep. But I never tell anyone this because I know they won’t understand.
I hate it when crying is the only way to feel better.
There are two types of people in the world: those who prefer to be sad among others, and those who prefer to be sad alone.
Tears are words the mouth can’t say nor can the heart bear.
A million words would not bring you back, I know because I tried, neither would a million tears, I know because I cried.
Tears shed for another person are not a sign of weakness. They are a sign of a pure heart. ― José N. Harris
Envy hurt exponentially more than heartbreak because your soul was torn in two, half soaring with happiness for another person, half mired in a well of selfpity and pain.
Ask me why I keep on loving you when it’s clear that you don’t feel the same way for me… the problem is that as much as I can’t force you to love me, I can’t force myself to stop loving you.
